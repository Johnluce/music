  <p class="aboutme">Hello, and welcome to my personal website! On this site, I have put together different pages that
    go over things in my skillset and hobbies. You can find things from videos, to songs, and even learning about
    sounds! Not only is this site displaying my sound abilities, but also my programming abilities. This entire site was
    coded by me using HTML and CSS. I encourage you to visit my <a href="https://github.com/Johnluce"
      class="github">Github</a>, but
    just know that I am in the very early stages of learning. </p>
