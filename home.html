    <p class="aboutme">Hello, and welcome to my personal website! On this site, I have put together different pages that
      go over things in my skillset and hobbies. You can find things from videos, to songs, to even learning about
      sounds! Not only is this site displaying my sound abilities, but also my programming abilities. This entire site
      was
      coded by me using HTML and CSS. I encourage you to visit my <a href="https://github.com/Johnluce"
        id="github">Github</a>, but
      just know that I am in the very early stages of learning.<br><br><br><br>
      About me: I was born and raised in Florida all my life while spending time in the keys, playing sports, and
      learning guitar. I graduated from Florida State University with a B.S. in entrepreneurship in spring 2020 right as
      covid was ramping up. Shortly after graduating I was able to earn an opportunity to work a great company called
      Argo AI as an autonomous vehicle systems test specialist. Argo AI manufactured software for self driving cars and
      had
      partnerships with Ford, VW, and Lyft with several locations across the U.S. and Germany. I grew with the company
      and had been promoted within my first year there. Unfortunately the company had shut down and everyone got laid
      off, including myself. However, I took the opportunity with my new free time to learn a new skill, hence the
      creation of this website!
