    <p class="aboutme1">Hello, and welcome to my personal website! On this site, I have put together different pages
      that
      go over things in my skillset and hobbies. You can find things from videos, to songs, to even learning about
      sounds! Not only is this site displaying my sound abilities, but also my programming abilities. This entire site
      was
      coded by me using HTML and CSS. I encourage you to visit my <a href="https://github.com/Johnluce"
        id="github">Github</a>, but
      just know that I am in the very early stages of learning.<br><br><br><br>

    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Florida all my life while spending time in the keys,
      playing
      sports, and
      learning guitar. I graduated from Florida State University with a B.S. in entrepreneurship in spring 2020 right as
      covid was ramping up. Since everyone was stuck at home with no end in sight, I decided to learn a new skill at
      home to keep myself occupied and happy. I've always loved music and went to some music festivals and concerts
      while I was in college and grew a passion for electronic music. Long story short, and three years later I have
      created several songs and have gotten way better at producing!</p>
