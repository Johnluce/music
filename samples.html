  <p class="words">One of my friends is a Twitch streamer so him and I were talking one day and I ended up sound
    designing a
    transition for him. He provided me with the video sample and I was able to create unique and cool sounding effects
    that would help him transition cameras when he streams. He's a really awesome guy that loves building gundams and
    playing games! Check out his channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/steez93">here!</a>
