      <p>All sounds are made of different variations of the four basic waveforms.</p>
      <p>Those waveforms are:</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Sine</li>
        <li>Square</li>
        <li>Trianlge</li>
        <li>Saw</li>

      <ol class="list">
        <li></li>

    <p>We can manipulate these waves in infinite ways to achieve<br> different sounds by using effects in
      synthesizers.<br> <br>Some effects are but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>sync</li>
      <li>bend</li>
      <li>harmonic stretch</li>
      <li>smear</li>
      <li>quantize</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="tools">
    <p class="toolsadd">As far as wave manipulation for effects, you can use any of the available effects in your
      synthesizer or with any plug-ins you may have. Some of the top synthesizers include Serum, Vital, and Omnisphere.
      These synthesizers offer a wide variety of ways to design sound in their own unique ways and are offered at
      different price points. For this example, we will use Vital made by Matt Tytel.</p>

    <p class="osc">As you can see in the OSC(oscillator) 1 lane, there is a sine wave placed which gives us the basic
      sound foundation of all sounds. However, there is more than OSC lane active. On the second one, there is also a
      sine
      wave. The third one has a very unatural shape, this is due to wavetable manipulation. This wave started off as a
      sine wave, but was edited to add several different harmonics to make it look the way it does, thus giving us a
      grittier sound. </p>
